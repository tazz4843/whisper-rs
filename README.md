# whisper-rs

Rust bindings to [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp/)

## Usage

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/tazz4843/whisper-rs.git

cd whisper-rs

cargo run --example basic_use

cargo run --example audio_transcription
```

```rust
use whisper_rs::{WhisperContext, WhisperContextParameters, FullParams, SamplingStrategy};

fn main() {
	let path_to_model = std::env::args().nth(1).unwrap();

	// load a context and model
	let ctx = WhisperContext::new_with_params(
		path_to_model,
		WhisperContextParameters::default()
	).expect("failed to load model");

	// create a params object
	let params = FullParams::new(SamplingStrategy::Greedy { best_of: 1 });

	// assume we have a buffer of audio data
	// here we'll make a fake one, floating point samples, 32 bit, 16KHz, mono
	let audio_data = vec![0_f32; 16000 * 2];

	// now we can run the model
	let mut state = ctx.create_state().expect("failed to create state");
	state
		.full(params, &audio_data[..])
		.expect("failed to run model");

	// fetch the results
	let num_segments = state
		.full_n_segments()
		.expect("failed to get number of segments");
	for i in 0..num_segments {
		let segment = state
			.full_get_segment_text(i)
			.expect("failed to get segment");
		let start_timestamp = state
			.full_get_segment_t0(i)
			.expect("failed to get segment start timestamp");
		let end_timestamp = state
			.full_get_segment_t1(i)
			.expect("failed to get segment end timestamp");
		println!("[{} - {}]: {}", start_timestamp, end_timestamp, segment);
	}
}
```

See [examples/basic_use.rs](examples/basic_use.rs) for more details.

Lower level bindings are exposed if needed, but the above should be enough for most use cases.
See the docs: https://docs.rs/whisper-rs/ for more details.

## Feature flags

All disabled by default unless otherwise specified.

* `raw-api`: expose whisper-rs-sys without having to pull it in as a dependency.
  **NOTE**: enabling this no longer guarantees semver compliance,
  as whisper-rs-sys may be upgraded to a breaking version in a patch release of whisper-rs.
* `cuda`: enable CUDA support. Implicitly enables hidden GPU flag at runtime.
* `hipblas`: enable ROCm/hipBLAS support. Only available on linux. Implicitly enables hidden GPU flag at runtime.
* `openblas`: enable OpenBLAS support.
* `metal`: enable Metal support. Implicitly enables hidden GPU flag at runtime.
* `vulkan`: enable Vulkan support. Implicitly enables hidden GPU flag at runtime.
* `log_backend`: allows hooking into whisper.cpp's log output and sending it to the `log` backend. Requires calling
* `tracing_backend`: allows hooking into whisper.cpp's log output and sending it to the `tracing` backend.

## Building

See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for instructions for building whisper-rs on Windows and OSX M1,
or with OpenVINO on any OS.
Besides OpenVINO, Linux builds should just
work out of the box.

## Troubleshooting

* Something other than Windows/macOS/Linux isn't working!
    * I don't have a way to test these platforms, so I can't really help you.
        * If you can get it working, please open a PR with any changes to make it work and build instructions in
          BUILDING.md!
* I get a panic during binding generation build!
    * You can attempt to fix it yourself, or you can set the `WHISPER_DONT_GENERATE_BINDINGS` environment variable.
      This skips attempting to build the bindings whatsoever and copies the existing ones. They may be out of date,
      but it's better than nothing.
        * `WHISPER_DONT_GENERATE_BINDINGS=1 cargo build`
    * If you can fix the issue, please open a PR!
